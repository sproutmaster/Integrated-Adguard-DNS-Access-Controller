# Integrated-Adguard-DNS-Access-Controller

This addon for [AdGuardHome](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) allows enterprise level DNS control at home via a webpage. It uses the REST API provided by Adguard-Home to control functionality.

DNS manager can be installed on the same DNS server or on a seperate server. 

(needs to implement web UI)
